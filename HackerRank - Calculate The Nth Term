// HackerRank - Calculate The Nth Term //
// Task 
There is a series, S, where the next term is the sum of pervious three terms. 
Given the first three terms of the series, a, b, and c respectively, you have to output the nth term of the series using recursion.
//
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int find_nth_term(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
    int first = a;
    int second = b;
    int third = c;
    int next;
  for(int i=4;i<=n;i++){
    next = first+second+third;
    first = second;
    second = third;
    third = next;
  }
  return third;
}

int main() {
    int n, a, b, c;
  
    scanf("%d %d %d %d", &n, &a, &b, &c);
    int ans = find_nth_term(n, a, b, c);
 
    printf("%d", ans); 
    return 0;
}
