// HackerRank - Sum and Difference of Two Numbers //
// Task
Your task is to take two numbers of int data type, two numbers of float data type as input and output their sum:
1-Declare 4 variables: two of type int and two of type float.
2-Read 2 lines of input from stdin (according to the sequence given in the 'Input Format' section below) and initialize your 4 variables.
3-Use the + and - operator to perform the following operations:
4-Print the sum and difference of two int variable on a new line.
5-Print the sum and difference of two float variable rounded to one decimal place on a new line.

    int int1,int2;
    float flt1,flt2;
    scanf("%d %d",&int1,&int2);
    scanf("%f %f",&flt1,&flt2);
    printf("%d %d\n", int1+int2, int1 - int2);
    printf("%.1f %.1f", flt1+flt2, flt1 - flt2);
    return 0;
